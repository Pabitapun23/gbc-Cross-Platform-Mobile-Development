## 1. Session01
In this session, I did all the installation process for react native (like - downloading and installing VS Code, NodeJS and Expo Go). I learned about basics of react native like - Text, Images, Views, styles and so on. Created and app that showcase an image and some text, and I also tested it on my phone and simulator.
